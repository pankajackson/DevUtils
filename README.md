### 3. Repository Migration Tool

**Description**:  
This tool helps in migrating a Git repository from one location to another while supporting repository creation on platforms like GitHub. It simplifies cloning, pushing, and managing repositories across different remotes.

**Features**

- Validate repository URLs and names.
- Automatically create new repositories on GitHub using the GitHub API or GitHub CLI (`gh`).
- Migrate repositories, including all branches, between remotes.
- Supports SSH and HTTPS protocols for repository URLs.
- Customizable repository privacy settings (public/private).
- Provides detailed error messages and logs for easy debugging.

**Dependencies**

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [GitHub CLI (gh)](https://cli.github.com/)

**Usage**

Run the script with the required arguments:

```bash
./git_migrator <source_repo_url> [options]
```

**Arguments**

- `source_repo_url`: URL of the source Git repository to migrate.

**Options**

- `--target-repo-url`: URL of the target repository. If not provided, a new repository will be created.
- `--repo-name`: Name of the new target repository (used if creating a repository).
- `--private`: Makes the new repository private (default: `private`).
- `--target-platform`: Target platform for repository creation (e.g., `github` or `bitbucket`). Default is `github`.
- `--target-proto`: Protocol for pushing to the repository (`ssh` or `https`). Default is `ssh`.

**Examples**

1. **Migrate a repository with automatic target creation**:

```bash
./git_migrator https://github.com/user/source-repo.git --repo-name new-repo --private
```

2. **Migrate to an existing target repository**:

```bash
./git_migrator https://github.com/user/source-repo.git --target-repo-url git@github.com:user/new-repo.git
```

3. **Use HTTPS instead of SSH for migration**:

```bash
./git_migrator https://github.com/user/source-repo.git --target-proto https
```

**Logs**

The script provides detailed logging output for each step. Logs can help identify missing tools, invalid inputs, or migration issues.

### **4. LXA Super Secure Folder Locker**

**Description**:  
LXA Super Secure Folder Locker is a Python-based utility that securely locks and encrypts files or directories using AES-256 encryption. It provides authentication using PAM, applies strict file permissions, and prevents unauthorized access using process-based locking.

**Features**:

- Lock and encrypt files and directories securely.
- Unlock and restore encrypted files or directories.
- Check the status of a locked/unlocked file or directory.
- Uses OpenSSL AES-256 encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation.
- Supports PAM authentication before unlocking (can be skipped if required).
- Prevents concurrent access via file-based locking.
- Provides verbose logging for debugging and monitoring.

**Dependencies**:

- Python 3.x
- `openssl` (for encryption and decryption)
- `pam` (install using `sudo pacman -S python-pam` or `pip install python-pam`)
- `tar` (for compressing directories before encryption)

---

**Usage**

1. Navigate to the script directory:

   ```bash
   cd devutils
   ```

2. Run the script with one of the following commands:

   ```bash
   python3 locker [command] [options]
   ```

**Commands**:
| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| `lock` | Lock and encrypt a file or directory | `python3 locker lock -p ~/Documents` |
| `unlock` | Unlock and decrypt a file or directory | `python3 locker unlock -p ~/Documents` |
| `status` | Check if a file/directory is locked or unlocked | `python3 locker status -p ~/Documents` |
| `lock (batch mode)` | Lock multiple directories using an index file | `python3 locker lock -i ~/index.locker` |

---

**Options**

| Option          | Description                                       | Example                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `-p, --path`    | Path to the file or directory to lock/unlock.     | `-p ~/Downloads`          |
| `-i, --index`   | Path to an index file containing multiple paths.  | `-i ~/index.locker`       |
| `-V, --verbose` | Enable verbose logging.                           | `--verbose`               |
| `--skip-auth`   | Skip user authentication (useful for automation). | `--skip-auth`             |
| `--skip-enc`    | Skip encryption (locks using permissions only).   | `--skip-enc`              |
| `--password`    | Provide a password for encryption/decryption.     | `--password mysecurepass` |

---

**Examples**

üîí **Lock a directory with encryption**:

```bash
python3 locker lock -p ~/Documents
```

üîì **Unlock a directory**:

```bash
python3 locker unlock -p ~/Documents
```

üìÇ **Check if a directory is locked**:

```bash
python3 locker status -p ~/Documents
```

üìÑ **Lock a directory without encryption (permission-based only)**:

```bash
python3 locker lock -p ~/Documents --skip-enc
```

üîê **Batch lock multiple directories using an index file**:

```bash
echo "/home/user/Documents" > ~/index.locker
echo "/home/user/Downloads" >> ~/index.locker
python3 locker lock -i ~/index.locker
```

---

**Security & Encryption Details**

- Uses **AES-256 encryption** via OpenSSL.
- Supports **PBKDF2 key derivation** with 100,000 iterations.
- Uses **PAM authentication** for access control.
- Implements **process-based file locking** to prevent simultaneous access.

---

**Troubleshooting**

‚ùå **Error: "Required binary 'openssl' is missing."**  
üîπ Solution: Install OpenSSL.

```bash
sudo apt install openssl  # Debian-based
sudo pacman -S openssl    # Arch-based
```

‚ùå **Error: "Authentication failed after 3 attempts."**  
üîπ Solution: Ensure you enter the correct system password. If PAM is misconfigured, try `--skip-auth` (not recommended for secure environments).

‚ùå **Error: "Failed to remove <path>"**  
üîπ Solution: The file might be **locked by another process**. Ensure no other instance is running.
